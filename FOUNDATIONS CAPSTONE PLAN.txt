myStrings: Viola


User will be able to “Add a New Set” of strings through a form submission that takes in details about the brand and the quality of the string. 


Once submitted by the user, information will be saved and a new card will pop up under “My Strings” populated with the details of the set of strings they submitted. They should also be able to update the card if needed.


Thinking of storing data for each set of strings as an object in an array:
{ brandName: string
  imgURL: string 
  date: string ? 
  tension: string
  strings: string (lol)
  toneQuality: Wanted to do a sliding scale. Does that translate into an integer?
  projection: integer
  rating: integer
  userNotes: string
}
Alternatively thinking of setting up a database and using Sequelize?


To-do:


* “Add a New Set” button
   * Brings up form for user to fill out
   * Most popular string brands will already be included as options to choose from (get), but a new brand can also be added (post)
* “My Strings” Section
   * createCard function to add to HTML with all the info for each set of strings user submitted
   * “Update Strings” button with “put” request
   * Have strings sorted by date, desc
