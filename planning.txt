TO CODE:

* "Add New Set" button will add a new object to an array to describe a set of strings, sent in through a form
   
   { 
     brandName: string (REQUIRED)
     imgURL: string 
     date: string ? (REQUIRED)
     tension: string 
     strings: string (lol)
     toneQuality: integer
     projection: integer
     rating: integer
     userNotes: string
   }

   - Make sure that form won't submit until string brand name and date are put in
   - Build out a slider for tone quality (warmth <-> brilliance)
   
* After new set is added, a card will be created and displayed for the new set of strings in the "My Strings" section
   - Build card in inner HTML
   - Populate with form submissions (axios)
   - Add to section
   - "Update Set Info" button -> updateSet function to change any info
   - "Delete Set" button -> deleteSet to delete a set card
